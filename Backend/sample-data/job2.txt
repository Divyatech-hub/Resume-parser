Graphic Designer

Position Summary

This position requires a person with a solid grasp of print and web design and print production skills (no coding skills required.) You should feel comfortable designing product packaging one day, and a website, or trade show materials the next. If you also have other skills such as illustration, video editing/production, or 3D animation that's a big plus. If you don't, you'll probably get the opportunity to reach outside your comfort zone.

You should be enthused by the prospect of interfacing directly with clients, project management, multi-tasking, problem solving, brainstorming, providing keen insights, and working in a collaborative environment.

Requirements
• Demonstrated experience in both print design and production
• Experience in web and user interface design
• Versatility to design in a variety of styles
• Intimate knowledge of Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign
• Ability to think both creatively and strategically
• Excellent writing and communication skills

Preferred
• Bachelor's degree in a related field
• 2 or more years applicable professional experience
• Video and audio production experience
• 3D design and animation
• Illustration (traditional or digital)
